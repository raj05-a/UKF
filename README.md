# Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)

A robust implementation of the Unscented Kalman Filter for non-linear state estimation. This class uses the Unscented Transform (UT) to pick sigma points and propagate them through non-linear functions, offering superior performance over the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for highly non-linear systems.
